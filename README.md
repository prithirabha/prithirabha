## About Me

Hello! I'm Prithiraj Rabha, a final year B.Tech CSE student with a strong interest in application development. I'm currently in the phase of exploring different possibilities and technologies to find my niche in the world of software development.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently exploring various technologies, with a focus on JavaFX for building interactive and user-friendly desktop applications.
- ðŸ’¬ Let's chat about your own exploration journey, application development, or any exciting tech topics you'd like to discuss!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm sometimes surprised by my own capabilities!
